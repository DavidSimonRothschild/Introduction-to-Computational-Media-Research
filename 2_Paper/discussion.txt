# 5: Discussion

## Interpretation

The underperformance of voting-related content (H1) might be explained by information overload: during voting periods, many actors post about the same issues, so individual posts do not stand out. Instagram and TikTok users might also be looking for entertainment rather than political information.

The null findings for sentiment (H2, H3) go against Robertson et al.'s (2023) finding that negativity drives news consumption. This could reflect Switzerland's consensus-oriented political culture, where negative messaging is less common. Platform algorithms might also neutralise sentiment effects.

The network analysis (H4) showed that parties mostly communicate within their own ideological circles. This limits the potential for conflict-driven engagement.

## Theoretical Implications

These findings raise the question of whether shareworthiness theory (Trilling et al., 2017) can be directly applied to Swiss political social media. News factors that predict engagement elsewhere—timeliness, negativity, conflict—do not seem to work the same way in the Swiss context, with its direct democracy and consensus tradition.

## Methodological Considerations

The mean-centred engagement score accounts for differences in follower counts between parties, making engagement levels comparable. However, it does not allow direct comparisons between parties—we cannot say whether SVP posts get more engagement than SP posts in absolute terms. All hypotheses are therefore within-party comparisons.

This is especially relevant for the sentiment analysis (H3), which was done at the party level. We can see party-specific effects, but cannot compare whether parties with more negative communication styles get different absolute engagement levels.

The score also combines likes, comments, and on TikTok shares and views, treating them equally. These forms of engagement might mean different things, and equal weighting might hide some effects.

## Limitations

The observation period only covered two national votes, limiting generalisability. Sentiment was measured with rule-based methods; more advanced approaches might capture emotional nuances better. Engagement metrics show visibility but not persuasion. Finally, we only looked at official party accounts, excluding individual politicians and grassroots actors.

## Future Research

Future studies should cover multiple voting cycles and compare Swiss patterns with other direct democracies like Germany. Qualitative analysis of high-engagement posts could reveal characteristics that automated methods miss. A mixed-method approach could help understand the underlying mechanisms.
